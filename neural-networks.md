# Neural Networks


1. Code up convolution.

        - Transposed convolution.

        - Dilated convolution.

        - Gradient of convolution.


2. Code up softmax with log-sum-exp trick.


3. Code up a simple segmentation algorithm.


4. Code up forward and backward pass for single hidden layer neural network.
